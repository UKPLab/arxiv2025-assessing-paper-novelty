# SUMMARY

The research landscape represented by these papers is characterized by a convergence of biologically plausible learning, predictive coding, and normative theoretical frameworks to explain the emergence and function of grid and place cells in the brain. The submission paper stands at the intersection of these trends, extending predictive coding to spatial domains and demonstrating grid cell emergence with local, Hebbian learning rules. Across the field, there is a clear progression from hand-designed, supervised, and backpropagation-based models toward self-organizing, self-supervised, and biologically grounded approaches, with increasing emphasis on analytical and normative justification. Empirical studies and new analytical methods provide essential validation and constraints, ensuring that computational models remain grounded in biological reality. The landscape is thus rich, dynamic, and increasingly unified, with predictive coding, sparse coding, and normative principles serving as central pillars.

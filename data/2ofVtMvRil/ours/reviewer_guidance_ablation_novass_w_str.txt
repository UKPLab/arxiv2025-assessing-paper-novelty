This assessment finds that the submission presents a novel application of predictive coding networks (PCNs and their temporal extension, tPCNs) to the emergence of grid cells in spatial navigation tasks, with a new analytical result linking tPCN Hebbian learning to truncated backpropagation through time (BPTT). While the use of predictive coding in this domain is new, the underlying mechanisms—local Hebbian learning and grid emergence from place cell inputs—closely parallel prior work using non-negative PCA and sparse coding models (e.g., Dordek et al., 2016; Sorscher et al., 2023). The claimed novelty of being the "first" to show grid cell emergence with biologically plausible learning in this framework is somewhat overstated, as similar outcomes have been demonstrated in related models, albeit not explicitly under the predictive coding paradigm. The analytical link to truncated BPTT is a meaningful contribution for this context, but similar equivalences have been established in the broader predictive coding literature. Overall, the work offers a valuable synthesis and reframing, but reviewers should recognize that several contributions are incremental extensions or reinterpretations of established results rather than fundamentally new mechanisms.

This assessment finds that the submission "Learning Grid Cells by Predictive Coding" is novel in demonstrating, for the first time, that grid cell-like representations can emerge in predictive coding networks (PCNs) and their temporal extensions (tPCNs) trained on spatial tasks, using a biologically plausible predictive coding learning rule. While prior work has shown grid cells arising in RNNs trained with backpropagation or with other local learning rules, and while the idea of grid cells as a basis for predictive representations is established, no previous work has shown that predictive coding itself can give rise to grid cells in a spatial context. The submission also provides an analytical connection between predictive coding learning and truncated BPTT, and extends predictive coding theory from vision and memory to spatial navigation and grid cell formation. The assessment recommends that the authors clearly distinguish their approach from related work, particularly Stachenfeld et al. (2017) and Helmholtz machine models, by emphasizing differences in learning rules and architectures. Overall, the work is judged to be a significant and original contribution to the literature on biologically plausible learning mechanisms for grid cells.

# NOVELTY DELTA ANALYSIS FOR REVIEWER SUPPORT

## 1. RESEARCH CONTEXT POSITIONING

**Situating the Submission:**
- The submission paper proposes that *predictive coding networks (PCNs)*, when trained with *biologically plausible plasticity rules*, can give rise to *grid cell-like representations*—specifically, hexagonal grid cells—within a spatial navigation context. It further extends this to *temporal predictive coding networks (tPCN)* for path integration.
- This work is positioned at the intersection of three major methodological clusters:
  - **Predictive Coding and Biologically Plausible Learning** (Cluster A): Extending predictive coding from sensory to spatial domains, with a focus on local learning rules.
  - **Sparse/Non-Negative Coding** (Cluster B): Employing non-negative constraints and sparse coding, which have been shown to yield grid-like representations in other models.
  - **Recurrent/Attractor Networks for Path Integration** (Cluster C): Relating to RNNs and attractor models that have previously demonstrated grid cell emergence via path integration tasks.

**Most Closely Related Prior Works:**
- **Predictive Coding in Memory and Sequence Learning:** Salvatori et al. (2021), Tang et al. (2023, 2024), Millidge et al. (2024) — PCNs and tPCNs for associative and sequential memory, but not previously for spatial/grid cell emergence.
- **Non-Negative PCA and Sparse Coding:** Dordek et al. (2016), Sorscher et al. (2023), Schaeffer et al. (2022) — Show grid cells emerge as non-negative principal components of place cell inputs.
- **RNNs for Path Integration:** Cueva & Wei (2018), Banino et al. (2018), Whittington et al. (2020), Sorscher et al. (2023) — RNNs trained for path integration develop grid-like representations.
- **Biologically Plausible Learning for Grid Cells:** Weber & Sprekeler (2018), Widloski & Fiete (2014), Kropff & Treves (2008) — Hebbian and STDP-based models for grid cell emergence.

**Independent Assessment:**
- The submission is not the first to show grid cell emergence from learning, nor the first to use biologically plausible rules. Its main delta is the *demonstration that predictive coding networks, specifically, can produce grid cells under local learning rules*—a combination not previously shown for spatial representations.
- The approach is methodologically closest to the predictive coding literature (Salvatori et al., Tang et al.), but those works did not address spatial/grid cell emergence.
- The use of non-negative constraints and DoS place cell inputs closely parallels the non-negative PCA literature (Dordek et al., Sorscher et al.), but those models are not predictive coding networks and often use feedforward architectures.
- The tPCN extension is analogous to RNNs for path integration, but with a predictive coding update rule and local learning.

**Problem Space and Evaluation:**
- The problem—biologically plausible learning of grid cells—has been addressed by several prior models, but not within the predictive coding framework.
- Evaluation (emergence of hexagonal grid cells, robustness, similarity to RNNs) is standard for the field.

## 2. AUTHOR CITATION ANALYSIS

**Patterns in Author Positioning:**
- The authors consistently position their work as the *first demonstration* of grid cell emergence in PCNs with biologically plausible learning, and as an *extension of predictive coding theory* to spatial representations.
- Prior works are often described as either not addressing 2D spatial learning (e.g., generative PCN models), or as lacking biological plausibility (e.g., RNNs with backpropagation), or as not being predictive coding models (e.g., non-negative PCA).

**Accuracy and Balance:**
- **Generative PCN Models (George et al., 2024; Bredenberg et al., 2021):**  
  - Authors claim these did not address 2D spatial learning. This is accurate; these works focus on associative/sequential memory, not spatial navigation.
- **RNN Path Integration Models (Cueva & Wei, Banino et al., Sorscher et al.):**  
  - Authors note these use backpropagation and do not explain the underlying learning mechanism in a biologically plausible way. This is generally accurate, though some works (e.g., Sorscher et al.) discuss non-negative constraints and biological relevance.
- **Non-Negative PCA (Dordek et al., Sorscher et al.):**  
  - Authors state these models can produce grid cells from place cell inputs, but are not predictive coding and cannot generalize to dynamical tasks. This is mostly accurate, though Sorscher et al. (2023) do discuss path integration and non-negative constraints in RNNs.
- **Biologically Plausible Grid Cell Models (Weber & Sprekeler, Widloski & Fiete, Kropff & Treves):**  
  - Authors describe these as highly specialized or limited to specific cell types. This is a fair characterization, though some of these models are more general than implied.
- **Predictive Coding and Backpropagation (Whittington & Bogacz, Song et al.):**  
  - Authors cite these to support the claim that predictive coding approximates backpropagation, justifying the use of PCNs as a biologically plausible alternative.

**Discrepancies and Rhetoric:**
- The authors sometimes understate the generality of non-negative PCA and RNN models, which have been shown to produce grid cells under a variety of conditions, including with some biological constraints.
- The distinction between "predictive coding" and "RNN" is sometimes blurred, as tPCN and RNNs can be architecturally similar, differing mainly in update and learning rules.
- The claim that prior PCN models did not address spatial learning is accurate, but the extension to spatial domains is a natural and incremental step rather than a conceptual leap.

  - Dordek et al. (2016), Sorscher et al. (2023): Grid cells from non-negative PCA of place cell inputs.
  - Salvatori et al. (2021), Tang et al. (2023, 2024): PCNs for associative/sequential memory, not spatial.
  - Cueva & Wei (2018), Banino et al. (2018): RNNs for path integration, grid cell emergence.
- **Claimed Difference:**  
  - First demonstration in *predictive coding networks* with *biologically plausible* (local) learning.
- **Independently Verified Difference:**  
  - Prior PCN works did not address spatial/grid cell emergence.
  - Prior grid cell models (non-negative PCA, RNNs) did not use predictive coding update rules.
  - The combination of predictive coding, spatial input, and local learning is new, but each component is individually established.
- **Substantive vs. Superficial:**  
  - The main novelty is architectural: using PCN/tPCN rather than RNN or feedforward models. The emergence of grid cells under non-negative constraints is not new; the learning rule (predictive coding with local updates) is the key delta.
  - The use of DoS place cell inputs and non-negativity is directly borrowed from prior work.
- **Author Characterization vs. Reality:**  
  - The claim of "first demonstration" is accurate for the specific combination, but the underlying mechanism (non-negative, locally learned representations yielding grid cells) is well established.

### Contribution 2: *Extends predictive coding theory to spatial representations in the MEC*

- **Most Similar Prior Work:**  
  - Salvatori et al. (2021), Tang et al. (2023, 2024): Predictive coding for memory, not spatial.
  - Barron et al. (2020): Predictive coding for hippocampo-neocortical interactions.
- **Claimed Difference:**  
  - Predictive coding applied to spatial navigation and grid cell emergence.
- **Independently Verified Difference:**  
  - Prior predictive coding works did not address spatial navigation or grid cells.
  - The extension is a natural application of the framework, not a conceptual innovation in predictive coding itself.
- **Substantive vs. Superficial:**  
  - The extension is incremental: applying an existing framework to a new domain, using established input encodings and constraints.
- **Author Characterization vs. Reality:**  
  - The claim is accurate, but the degree of novelty is limited by the straightforwardness of the extension.

### Contribution 3: *Provides a unified learning algorithm for diverse cortical representations*

- **Most Similar Prior Work:**  
  - Salvatori et al. (2021), Tang et al. (2023, 2024): PCNs for memory.
  - Dordek et al. (2016), Sorscher et al. (2023): Non-negative PCA for grid cells.
- **Claimed Difference:**  
  - Unification of learning for spatial, associative, and sequential memory in a single framework.
- **Independently Verified Difference:**  
  - The framework is unified in the sense that PCNs can be applied to multiple domains, but the actual implementation for spatial tasks closely follows prior work in input encoding and constraints.
- **Substantive vs. Superficial:**  
  - The unification is more a matter of framework generality than a new algorithmic insight.
- **Author Characterization vs. Reality:**  
  - The claim is somewhat overstated; the main novelty is in application, not in a fundamentally new learning algorithm.

## 5. CRITICAL ASSESSMENT CONSIDERATIONS

- **Potential Overstatement of Novelty:**  
  - The claim of "first demonstration" is accurate for the specific combination (PCN + spatial + local learning), but the underlying principles (non-negative, locally learned representations yielding grid cells) are well established.
  - The extension of predictive coding to spatial domains is a natural, incremental step.
- **Empirical Improvements:**  
  - The emergence of grid cells may depend more on input encoding (DoS place cells) and non-negativity than on the predictive coding update rule per se.
- **Terminology Differences:**  
  - The distinction between "predictive coding" and "RNN" is sometimes blurred; tPCN and RNNs can be architecturally similar, differing mainly in update and learning rules.
- **Routine Adaptations:**  
  - The application of PCNs to spatial tasks is a routine adaptation of the framework, not a conceptual leap.
- **"Unified Algorithm" Claims:**  
  - The unification is more about framework generality than a new algorithmic insight.

## 7. KEY OBSERVATION SUMMARY

- **Most Significant Independently Verified Differences:**
  - The submission is the first to show that *predictive coding networks* (PCNs/tPCNs), when trained with *biologically plausible local learning rules*, can produce *grid cell-like representations* in spatial navigation tasks.
- **Main Relationships to Existing Research:**
  - Builds directly on predictive coding models for memory (Salvatori et al., Tang et al.), non-negative PCA models for grid cells (Dordek et al., Sorscher et al.), and RNNs for path integration (Cueva & Wei, Banino et al.).
- **Strongest Differentiation:**
  - The specific combination of predictive coding, spatial input, and local learning is new.
- **Weakest Differentiation:**
  - The underlying mechanism (non-negative, locally learned representations yielding grid cells) is well established; the extension to spatial domains is incremental.
  - The "unified algorithm" claim is more about framework generality than a new learning principle.
- **Discrepancies Between Author Characterization and Independent Assessment:**
  - The novelty is somewhat overstated; the main advance is architectural and integrative, not conceptual.
  - The necessity of predictive coding (vs. RNNs or non-negative PCA) for grid cell emergence is not clearly established; input encoding and non-negativity appear to be the critical factors.

---

**In summary:**  
The submission provides a new demonstration that predictive coding networks, when trained with local, biologically plausible learning rules, can produce grid cell-like representations in spatial navigation tasks. This is a novel combination, but the underlying principles are well established in the literature. The extension of predictive coding to spatial domains is incremental, and the main technical advance is architectural rather than conceptual. The authors' characterizations of prior work are generally accurate but sometimes understate the generality and adaptability of existing models. Additional relevant work could be cited, and the necessity of predictive coding (vs. other mechanisms) for grid cell emergence remains an open question. Reviewers should weigh the integrative nature of the contribution against the incremental nature of the advance.

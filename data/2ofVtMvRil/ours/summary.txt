This submission demonstrates that predictive coding networks (PCNs), trained with biologically plausible local learning rules, can give rise to grid cell-like representations in spatial navigation tasksâ€”a combination not previously shown, though each component is individually established in prior work. The main novelty lies in applying predictive coding, previously used for memory and sequence learning, to spatial domains with local learning, but the emergence of grid cells from non-negative, locally learned representations is already well documented in the literature. The work is architecturally and integratively novel, but conceptually incremental, as the critical factors for grid cell emergence (input encoding and non-negativity) are borrowed from existing models. The authors' claims of "first demonstration" are accurate for the specific combination, but their characterization of prior work sometimes understates the generality and adaptability of non-negative PCA and RNN models. Reviewers should recognize the integrative advance while noting that the necessity of predictive coding (versus other mechanisms) for grid cell emergence is not clearly established, and the contribution is primarily an incremental extension rather than a conceptual leap.

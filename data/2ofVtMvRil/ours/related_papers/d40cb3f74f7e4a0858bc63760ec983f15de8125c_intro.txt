When a rodent explores an open arena, grid cells in its medial entorhinal cortex discharge in spatial firing patterns that resemble hexagonal lattices (Hafting et al., 2005). The spatial scales of these lattices approximate a geometric series so that discrete grid-cell modules arise (Stensola et al., 2012). The grid patterns of cells within the same module are aligned and differ only by a global phase offset. When the animal moves along a linear track, grid cells seem to respond differently. Their spike activity is still spatially modulated but no longer periodic. In addition, the peak firing rates of a given grid cell differ strongly from field to field (Lipton et al., 2007; Brun et al., 2008; Derdikman et al., 2009; Gupta et al., 2014). Firing fields recorded along one running direction are, however, compatible with a slice through a two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal lattice (Yoon et al., 2016). This suggests that the animal interprets the one-dimensional (1D) linear track as part of a two-dimensional environment, and supports the view that grid cells provide a universal metric for spatial navigation.

This view is challenged by the observation that grid fields measured along a linear track vary between left-to-right and right-to-left runs (Lipton et al., 2007; Brun et al., 2008; Derdikman et al., 2009; Gupta et al., 2014; Perez-Escobar et al., 2016), suggesting that the one-dimensional activity patterns of a grid cell cannot correspond to a single slice through the same fixed two-dimensional lattice. Instead, translations, rotations, or even scale transformations might be needed to explain the experimental data. Because the study of Yoon et al. (2016) was restricted to runs in one direction, it could not address this important aspect.

To analyze how direction-dependent 1D activity patterns are embedded in 2D lattices, we investigated four different scenarios. First, grid-cell responses could, in principle, correspond to slices through the same one lattice (OL) for both running directions (Fig. 1_A_). Given the experimental evidence (see Brun et al., 2008), this is an unlikely scenario. Nevertheless, it provides a helpful null hypothesis. Next, we considered two scenarios motivated by re-mapping experiments in 2D environments. Larger changes (e.g., moving the animal to a new room) can cause a translation and rotation, while smaller changes to the environment, such as changing the enclosure but not the room (Fyhn et al., 2007) or nonmetric context changes (Marozzi et al., 2015) typically lead to a pure translational shift of the grid pattern within the enclosure. Taking such remapping experiments into account, we hypothesized that when considering two opposite running directions, the underlying 2D patterns could be identical except of a translational (\(S\)) shift or an additional rotation (\(S\)+\(R\)), as shown in Figure 1, \(B\) and C. Note that rotations by multiples of 60\({}^{\circ}\) are equivalent to pure shifts (\(S\)). Finally, the two hexagonal lattices might also be scaled differently (\(S\)+\(R\)+\(Sc\)), as depicted in Figure 1\(D\).

Here, we show that a joint hexagonal firing pattern explains the linear-track data for both running directions as soon as a translational shift (\(S\)) is allowed. Importantly, added rotations (\(S\)+\(R\)) or additional scalings (\(S\)+\(R\)+\(Sc\)) of the grid are not needed. The agreement between measured data and the model framework improves further if the firing rates of the underlying 2D grid field can vary from field to field, as has been suggested recently (Diehl et al., 2017; Dunn et al., 2017; Ismakov et al., 2017).

These findings reveal that the hexagonal firing-field structure of grid cells can persist even in quasi one-dimensional environments. This does not imply that the same is true in enclosures with strong asymmetries, as is evident from the seemingly irregular arrangement of grid fields in trapezoidal arenas (Krupic et al., 2015). Our results do, however, provide a basis to quantify and interpret the grid-cell activity of animals running on linear tracks in virtual reality (Domnisoru et al., 2013; Schmidt-Hieber and Hausser, 2013) and could help to detect and categorize grid cells without experiments in two-dimensional arenas.

This submission presents the first explicit demonstration that grid cell-like representations can emerge in predictive coding networks (PCN/tPCN) trained with local, biologically plausible Hebbian learning, rather than backpropagation through time (BPTT) or hand-engineered connectivity. While the conceptual link between predictive representations and grid cells is well established in the successor representation (SR) literature (e.g., Stachenfeld et al., 2017), the authors' main contribution is an implementation advance: showing grid cell emergence in classical PCN architectures. The work also provides an analytical connection between tPCN Hebbian learning and truncated BPTT, and reports empirical robustness of grid cell emergence under various architectural conditions, including the absence of velocity inputs. However, the novelty is primarily in the implementation and learning rule, as the broader predictive coding framework's relevance to grid cells is not new. Reviewers should note that the submission extends predictive coding theory to spatial navigation in a biologically plausible manner, but the conceptual advance over prior predictive map theories is incremental.
